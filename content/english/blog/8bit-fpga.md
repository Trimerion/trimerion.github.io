## Overview

Computers are mysterious. These machines have always been so enigmatic to most people. I can guarantee that if you ask someone on the road how computers work, they would most likely just answer "*I don't know*". 

I was like that for a long time, even after I started learning programming. So I decided that I will learn how a computer works by building one.

At first, I was thinking about building a breadboard computer like [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). But then I realized that I don't really have access to a lot of the components that Ben used where I live so I decided to make this computer using software, and since I just started learning **Verilog**, I decided to put my **Verilog** skill to the test by making this computer.

## Toolchain

For this project, I decided to use some open source toolchain for FPGA. When I was doing some research, I found [*Apio*](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio), which is an open source ecosystem of FPGA tools, so I decided to use *Apio* for this project.


Here's how you install Apio:
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install Apio with `pip` (if the `pip` command is not available, run `easy_install pip`)

```bash
$ pip install -U apio
```

- Install necessary packages:

```bash
$ apio install -a
```

Now you can use Apio for your project. Check out Apio's [quick start](https://apiodoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/quick_start.html) page to learn how to use it.

## The architecture

I based this computer's architecture on the *SAP-1* in [Digital Computer Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Jerald-Malvino-dp-0074622358/dp/0074622358/ref=dp_ob_image_bk).

![8bit architecture pic](/images/8bit-fpga/8bit-architecture.png)

The modules share some common signal path: *clk*, *rst* and *out*.
- *clk*: The clock signal
- *rst*: The reset signal (resets everything back to 0)
- *out*: The output of each modules (connected to the bus for communication between modules)

I combined the *MAR* module from the original *SAP-1* architecture with the *RAM* module to make the memory module. Some signals may also have different names as I'm basing the architecture of this computer off of my memory of the *SAP-1* architecture.

This won't be an exact copy of the *SAP-1* but it's close enough and it's still a functioning 8-bit computer.

So let's get to making this computer.

## The components

Let's see how each components of the computer works:
1. *The bus*: This is where all the data is sent through. It is 8-bit wide and it is how components communicate with and send data to each other. The bus have *enable* signals that will allow it to multiplex between the different outputs of the modules.
2. *The clock*: This module synchronizes all the components. Think of it like a conductor leading an orchestra. This component will output the *clk_in* signal if *hlt* is low, and output 0 if *hlt* is high. The *hlt* signal is used to implement the **HLT** instruction later on.
3. *The program counter*: This module holds the next instruction to be executed. This module counts from `0x0` to `0xF` as there's only 16 bytes of memory in this computer. The *inc* signal tells this module to increment the value in itself by 1.
4. *The instruction register*: This module loads the instruction from memory and seperates the opcode and the data. The upper 4 bits of the instruction is the opcode and the lower 4 bits is the address of the data. For the instructions that don't require data (like **HLT**), the lower 4 bits will be ignored.
5. *The accumulator (A register)*: This is the main register of the computer. This stores the intermediate data during an execution. This needs a *load* signal to load values into it from the bus.
6. *The B register*: This a buffer register used to perform arithmetic operations. It's basically a supporting register for the A register. It holds the number to be added to or subtracted from the A register. It also accepts a *load* signal to load values into it from the bus.
7. *The adder*: This module is responsible for doing all the math in this computer. It can add (A + B) or subtract (A - B). It doesn't use the clock signal as it is constantly calculating and outputing the result based on the A and B values.
8. *The memory*: There's 16 bytes of memory in this computer. The memory has a 4-bit register called the *Memory Address Register* or *MAR* for short, which temporarily holds a memory address of data or instruction in memory. This stored address is sent to the *RAM* where data and instructions are read from. It takes the computer 2 cycles to read from memory: 1st cycle will load an address from the bus into the *MAR*, 2nd cycle will use the value in the *MAR* to address into the *RAM* and output the value. This computer will initialize the memory by loading from a file called *program.bin*
9. *The controller*: This is the most complicated part about the computer. It will decide what the computer will do next by asserting different control signals in a 12-bit control word at different execution stages. We'll talk about the different control signals and execution stages later on.

## The execution stages
Instruction execution occurs in a series of *stages* (each stage takes 1 clock cycle). This computer has **6** stages (0 to 5). It counts up to 5 then goes back to 0 then continue (counts using a 3-bit register)

Opcode is passed from the *instruction register* into the *controller* to do things based on what instruction is. Output of the *controller* is the 12 control signals used to control all the other modules. Different stages of different instructions will assert different signals to accomplish different things.

Control signals:
- *hlt*: halt execution
- *pc_inc*: increment program counter
- *pc_en*: put value of the pc onto the bus
- *mar_load*: load address into memory address register
- *mem_en*: put value from memory into the bus
- *ir_load*: load value from bus into intruction register
- *ir_en*: put value in ir onto the bus
- *a_load*: load value from bus into A register
- *a_en*: put value in A onto the bus
- *b_load*: load value from bus into B register
- *adder_sub*: subtract value in B from A
- *adder_en*: put value in adder onto the bus

## The instructions

This computer has 4 instructions:
| Opcode | Instruction | Description |
| :----: | ----------- | ----------- |
| *0000* | **LDA $x** | Load value at memory location *$x* into A |
| *0001* | **ADD $x** | Add value at memory location *$x* with value in A and store the sum in A |
| *0010* | **SUB $x** | Subtract value at memory location *$x* from value in A and store the difference in A |
| *1111* | **HLT** | Halt program execution |

Every instruction has the same first 3 stages:
- **Stage 0**: Put the *PC* onto bus and load that value into *MAR* (*pc_en* -> *mar_load*)
- **Stage 1**: Increment *PC* (*pc_inc*)
- **Stage 2**: Put value in memory at the *MAR* address onto the bus and load that into the *IR* (*mem_en* -> *ir_load*)

Next 3 stages differs from instruction to instruction:
| Stage | LDA | ADD | SUB | HLT |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stage 3** | Put instruction operand onto the bus and load that value into MAR (*ir_en* -> *mar_load*) | Put instruction operand onto the bus and load that value into MAR (*ir_en* -> *mar_load*) | Put instruction operand onto the bus and load that value into MAR (*ir_en* -> *mar_load*) | Halt the clock (*hlt*) |
| **Stage 4** | Put value in memory at the MAR address onto the bus and load that into the A register (*mem_en* -> *a_load*) | Put value in memory at the MAR address onto the bus and load that into the B register (*mem_en* -> *b_load*) | Put value in memory at the MAR address onto the bus and load that into the B register (*mem_en* -> *b_load*) | Idle |
| **Stage 5** | Idle | Put value in the adder onto the bus and load that into the A register (*adder_en* -> *a_load*) | Subtract then put the value in the adder onto the bus and load that into the A register (*adder_sub* -> *adder_en* -> *a_load*) | Idle |


## Verilog modules

These modules will be programmed in *Verilog*. There will be a top module that will be used to connect all of these components together. There will also be a top module testbench to test out the design and check if the computer is working or not. 

### The clock
```verilog
module clock(
	input hlt, // halt signal
	input clk_in,

	output clk_out
);

	assign clk_out = hlt ? 1'b0 : clk_in;

endmodule
```

### The program counter
```verilog
module pc(
	input clk,
	input rst,
	input inc,

	output[7:0] out
);
	
	reg[3:0] pc;
	
	always @ (posedge clk, posedge rst)
	begin
		if (rst)
		begin
			pc <= 4'b0;
		end else if (inc)
		begin

	always @ (posedge clk, posedge rst)
	begin
		if (rst)
		begin

	end

	assign out = reg_a;

endmodule
```

	initial begin
		$readmemh("program.bin", ram);
	end

	reg[3:0] mar;
	reg[7:0] ram[0:15];		// 16 8-bit wide elements

	always @ (posedge clk, posedge rst)
	begin
		if (rst)
		begin
			mar <= 4'b0;
		end else if (load)
		begin

	end

	assign out = ram[mar];

endmodule
```

## Programming the computer
Finally, to program the computer, we can program the bytes directly into a file named `program.bin`. This file will get loaded into the memory module when the computer starts. Here's an example program:
```bin
0D 2E 1F F0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 04 02
```

This is the annotated version of the example program:
```bin
$0      0D      // LDA $D   Load A with the value at address $D
$1      1E      // ADD $E   Add the value at address $E to A
$2      2F      // SUB $F   Subtract the value at address $F from A
$3      F0      // HLT      Stop execution
$4      00      // Padding byte
$5      00      // Padding byte
$6      00      // Padding byte
$7      00      // Padding byte
$8      00      // Padding byte
$9      00      // Padding byte
$A      00      // Padding byte
$B      00      // Padding byte
$C      00      // Padding byte
$D      05      // Data
$E      04      // Data
$F      02      // Data
```

And after all of that, we have the end result, a functioning 8-bit computer:

We can see that the data in *reg_a* is getting added and subtracted with the data in *reg_b* just like how we programmed it in `program.bin`.
