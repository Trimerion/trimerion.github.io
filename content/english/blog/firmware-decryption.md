I've been doing some research into reverse engineering for a while now. I've also been learning about firmware and embedded systems for a long time. And I thought "Wouldn't it be cool to combine these to skills to do something?". So I decided to try decrypting the encrypted firmware of the a Serial-To-WiFi device. I've documented my process here in this blog post.

## The device

I recently read that there was a vulnerability in the [*Moxa NPort W2150A Serial-To-Wifi*](https://www.moxa.com/en/products/industrial-edge-connectivity/serial-device-servers/wireless-device-servers/nport-w2150a-w2250a-series) device that exploit stack-based buffer overflow. I decided I would take a shot at decrypting the firmware for this device, which was encrypted by default.

I decided to find an older version of the firmware an try to crack it. After looking through the internet, I found [*v2.2*](https://www.moxa.com/Moxa/media/PDIM/S100000210/moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom). So I downloaded the firmware and got to decrypting.

## The analysis

I want try to extract any kind of information about this firmware first and see how encrypted the file is.

The first thing I did when I downloaded the firmware was running it through `file`:

```bash
$ file moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom
moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom: data
```

The output says `data` which means the `file` command cannot detect any file signatures within this `.rom` file. So this is an indication that this file has been heavily encrypted. 

Next, I use `hexdump` to check out the general structure of the firmware:
```bash
hexdump -C moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom | head
```

![hexdump](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-hexdump.png)

We can see that at the beginning of the file is `NPW2X50A8k` which is the name of the devices. After that is some padding or null bytes and after that is some random bytes. So there's not much information we can extract from here. 

Since we can't really find anything using `file` and `hexdump`, let's use a more powerful tool. I'll use `binwalk` as that tool allows me to walk through the entire binary and find file signatures and compression methods. The tool also provides extensive binary analysis tools.

```bash
binwalk moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom
```

Running this `binwalk` command, `binwalk` can only find a `MySQL` file, which is most likely a false positive because I don't think a Serial-To-WiFi device would need to use a database. So we can't really extract any information from this. So what else can we do now?

I started looking through older versions of this firmware. When I was looking through the [release note](https://www.moxa.com/Moxa/media/PDIM/S100000210/W2250A%20Series_moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-1.11.rom_Software%20Release%20History.pdf) of version *1.11*, I found this interesting note:

![release note](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-version11-release-note.png)

Version *1.11* is a requirement for upgrading to version *2.2*. This got me wondering if the encryption for the firmware was added with the v2.2 update. So I downloaded the [v1.11](https://www.moxa.com/Moxa/media/PDIM/S100000210/moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-1.11.rom) release and start checking out the firmware.

Next, I tried `binwalk` on this firmware:
```bash
binwalk moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-1.11.rom
```

![old version binwalk](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-older-version-binwalk.png)

And we can confirm that this firmware is not encrypted. There are 2 things that looks interesting here: The 2 `squashfs` filesystems compressed by `gzip`. `squashfs` is an entire Linux filesystem compressed. 

Now that we know what is in the firmware, let's extract it:
```bash
binwalk -e moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-1.11.rom
```

This command will extract the *v1.11* firmware into the `_moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-1.11.rom.extracted` directory:

![extracted screenshot](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-extracted-screenshot.png)

There are some `squashfs-root` directories, which contains the firmware's Linux filesystem. Before we can access this, we need to give the directories correct permissions to be able to access it:
```bash
chmod +x -R squashfs-root*
```

Now we can access the `squashfs-root` directories. This looks like a *UNIX* filesystem:

![old version filesystem](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-old-version-filesystem.png)

After searching through the directories, I stumbled across an interesting file in the `lib` directory of `squashfs-root`: `libupgradeFirmware.so`. Because we found out earlier that upgrading to *v2.2* requires us to have *v1.11*, I'm guessing this `libupgradeFirmware.so` library will contain some information about how the firmware is encrypted. So let's analyze this binary.

## The **libupgradeFirmware.so** reverse engineering

I'll use [`Ghidra`](https://ghidra-sre.org/) as my decompiler of choice. It's open source and it's feature full.

I created a new project, exported the `libupgradeFirmware.so` file into the Ghidra project and check out the functions available in the binary:

![ghidra function window](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-ghidra-function-window.png)

We can see here that this binary uses **AES** block encryption algorithm. Specifically **ECB** mode (Electronic Code Block mode). Because **ECB** mode generates repeating ciphertext from repeating plaintext, it is easy for someone to derive the secret key and decrypt the encryption. So this represents a huge vulnerability, which we can exploit.

![ghidra fw_decrypt](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-ghidra-fw_decrypt.png)

We can also see that there's a function called `fw_decrypt`. This is probably the firmware decrypt function, which means it's quite important in this firmware. Let's see what other functions this `fw_decrypt` function calls:

![fw_decrypt call graph](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-fw_decrypt-call-graph.png)

`fw_decrypt` is calling 3 other functions: `cal_crc32` (which is used for checksum and data integrity validation), `memcpy` (memory copy), and `ecb128Decrypt` (which is probably the AES 128 ECB mode decrypt function). 

Since we're trying to decrypt the firmware, let's checkout the function call graph of the `ecb128Decrypt` function:

![ecb128decrypt call graph](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-ecb128decrypt-call-graph.png)

So this function is directly calling some AES functions from the *OpenSSL* library. So to decrypt this firmware, we can use the *OpenSSL* command-line command in AES mode. However, we need to obtain the key used to encrypt this firmware to decrypt it. 

# Reversing the ecb128Decrypt function

I'll try to reverse engineer this to get the key. We'll start by reversing the `ecb128Decrypt` function:

![ecb128decrypt function reversed](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-ecb128decrypt-function-reversed.png)

Let's analyze this. I'll rename and retype the variables as we analyze the program.

First, we'll checkout the AES function. The `AES_set_decrypt_key` takes in a user key and expand it to an AES key. We can see that the `AES_set_decrypt_key` function uses `auStack_30`. In the [OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/), we know that the first argument in this function is a user key. So we can rename `auStack_30` to `user_key`. `AStack_124` is the AES key so we'll rename it to `aes_key`, this will be used for decryption later on.

This function also takes in a key size argument too. In our program, the key size argument is *0x80* which is *128* in decimal, so we are working with a *128-bit* AES key. I'll change the type of this *0x80* to decimal.

Next, we can see in the `strncpy` line, it's copying 16 bytes of `param_4` into `auStack_30`, which is user key. So `param_4` is probably the decryption key because `user_key` will later be used in the AES decrypt function for decryption. We'll rename this to `decrypt_key`.

We'll take a look at the `in` and `out` variables, we can see that they contain the values of `param_1` and `param_2` and they are offseted by *0x10* (or 16). These 2 variables are also passed into the `AES_ecb_encrypt` function. 

The `AES_ecb_encrypt` function takes in an input buffer, an output buffer, an AES key and a encrypt mode. Since the encrypt mode for the `AES_ecb_encrypt` function is 0 in this case, `AES_ecb_encrypt` will be put into decrypt mode. So this will decrypt the data in the input buffer using the AES key and output the decrypted data to the output buffer.

So we can deduct that the `param_1` and `param_2` variables are the input buffer and output buffer. We'll rename `param_1` to `decrypt_in` and `param_2` to `decrypt_out` and retype them as `uchar*` because `in` and `out` are both `uchar*`.

Next, we can see that `iVar1` is the index variable used in the loop, and it only stop when it is equal to `param_3 + -0x28`. So I think `param_3` is the size of the input buffer. We'll rename `param_3` to `decrypt_size`. We can see that `decrypt_size` needs to be offseted by `-0x28`, this might be an indication that there's some padding bytes in front of the file. If you remember back when we tried to hexdump the firmware, we found some padding 0 bytes on top of the file. So this firmware was offseted by *0x28* or 40 bytes.

Here's the renamed and retyped function:

![ecb128decrypt reversed renamed](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-ecb128decrypt-reversed-renamed.png)

Now, we can say how `ecb128Decrypt` works: It takes in an encrypted input buffer (`decrypt_in`), decrypt it with a key (`decrypt_key`), and output it into an output buffer (`decrypt_out`).

# Reversing the fw_decrypt function

Now we understand how the `ecb128Decrypt` function (which is the main function used in the `fw_decrypt` function) works, we'll check out the `fw_decrypt` function and see how that works.

> **Note**: The code for `fw_decrypt` is quite long so I'll copy it into a code block here instead of taking a picture

```c
undefined8 fw_decrypt(void *param_1,uint *param_2,undefined4 param_3)
{
  undefined4 uVar1;
  uint *puVar2;
  byte *pbVar3;
  uint decrypt_size;
  uint uVar4;
  void *__src;
  uint *local_24;
  undefined4 uStack_20;
  
  decrypt_size = *param_2;
  if (param_1 == (void *)0x0) {
    uVar1 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  else if (*(char *)((int)param_1 + 0xe) == '\x01') {
    if ((((decrypt_size < 0x29) || (decrypt_size < (*(byte *)((int)param_1 + 0xd) + 10) * 4)) ||
        (decrypt_size < *(uint *)((int)param_1 + 8))) || ((decrypt_size - 0x28 & 0xf) != 0)) {
      uVar1 = 0xfffffffe;
    }
    else {
      pbVar3 = &passwd.3309;
      while (pbVar3 + 4 != ubuf) {
        *pbVar3 = *pbVar3 ^ 0xa7;
        pbVar3[1] = pbVar3[1] ^ 0x8b;
        pbVar3[2] = pbVar3[2] ^ 0x2d;
        pbVar3[3] = pbVar3[3] ^ 5;
        pbVar3 = pbVar3 + 4;
      }
      local_24 = param_2;
      uStack_20 = param_3;
      ecb128Decrypt((uchar *)param_1,(uchar *)param_1,decrypt_size,&passwd.3309);
      uVar4 = *(uint *)((int)param_1 + 8);
      if (((0x28 < uVar4) && ((*(byte *)((int)param_1 + 0xd) + 10) * 4 < uVar4)) &&
         (*(char *)((int)param_1 + 0xe) == '\0')) {
        __src = (void *)((int)param_1 + (uint)*(byte *)((int)param_1 + 0xd) * 4 + 0x24);
        memcpy(&local_24,__src,4);
        puVar2 = (uint *)cal_crc32((int)__src + 4,uVar4 + (*(byte *)((int)param_1 + 0xd) + 10) * -4,
                                   0);
        if (puVar2 == local_24) {
          if ((int)decrypt_size < (int)uVar4) {
            uVar1 = 0xfffffffb;
          }
          else {
            *param_2 = uVar4;
            uVar1 = 0;
          }
          goto LAB_0001191c;
        }
      }
      uVar1 = 0xfffffffc;
    }
  }
  else {
    uVar1 = 0;
  }
LAB_0001191c:
  return CONCAT44(param_1,uVar1);
}
```

Let's analyze each parts. On this line:

```c
ecb128Decrypt((uchar *)param_1,(uchar *)param_1,decrypt_size,&passwd.3309);
```

Since we know how `ecb128Decrypt` works, we can see that the parameters `decrypt_in` and `decrypt_out` takes in the same variable: `param_1`. So it looks like the variable is being decrypted into the same place. We'll rename `param_1` to `fw_buffer` and retype it to `uchar*`.

The `ecb128Decrypt` also takes in a variable called `decrypt_size`, which got its value from `param_2` (see line `decrypt_size = *param_2;`). So we can rename `param_2` to `fw_buffer_size`. 

```c
ecb128Decrypt(fw_buffer,fw_buffer,decrypt_size,&passwd.3309);
```

Next, the first conditional "*if*" statement checks whether `param_1` (`fw_buffer`) is *null* or not. If it is, it sets the `uVar2` to *0xffffffff*. We know that `uVar2` is the return value of this `fw_decrypt` function so we'll rename this to `return_value`. 

By trying to set the `return_value` to *0xffffffff*, it's trying to overflow the `return_value` into the negative range. We can check what negative number this will overflow into by changing the data type of `return_value` from `uint` to `int`:

```c
if (fw_buffer == (uchar *)0x0) {
    return_value = -1;
}
```

So this will just return *-1*, which means failed in C, if the `fw_buffer` is *null*. By figuring out what `uVar2` is, we can also derive the return type of this `fw_decrypt` function, which is `int`. 

```c
int fw_decrypt(uchar *fw_buffer,uint *fw_buffer_size,undefined4 param_3)
```

We're getting close, the function is much easier to read now.

In the *if* statement inside the *else if* statement, it's checking for errors and valid firmware size and return a negative value if it's not successful, nothing interesting yet. The *else* statement after that looks quite interesting though:

```c
else {
  pbVar3 = &passwd.3309;
  while (pbVar3 + 4 != ubuf) {
    *pbVar3 = *pbVar3 ^ 0xa7;
    pbVar3[1] = pbVar3[1] ^ 0x8b;
    pbVar3[2] = pbVar3[2] ^ 0x2d;
    pbVar3[3] = pbVar3[3] ^ 5;
    pbVar3 = pbVar3 + 4;
  }
  local_24 = fw_buffer_size;
  uStack_20 = param_3;
  ecb128Decrypt(fw_buffer,fw_buffer,decrypt_size,&passwd.3309);
  uVar4 = *(uint *)(fw_buffer + 8);
  if (((0x28 < uVar4) && (bVar1 = fw_buffer[0xd], (bVar1 + 10) * 4 < uVar4)) &&
     (fw_buffer[0xe] == '\0')) {
    memcpy(&local_24,fw_buffer + (uint)bVar1 * 4 + 0x24,4);
    puVar2 = (uint *)cal_crc32((int)(fw_buffer + (uint)bVar1 * 4 + 0x24 + 4),
                               uVar4 + (fw_buffer[0xd] + 10) * -4,0);
    if (puVar2 == local_24) {
      if ((int)uVar4 <= (int)decrypt_size) {
        *fw_buffer_size = uVar4;
        return 0;
      }
      return -5;
    }
  }
  return_value = -4;
}
```

Let's go through each part here:

```c
pbVar3 = &passwd.3309;
```

`passwd.3309` looks like a password variable. We know that this was also passed into `ecb128Decrypt` as the `decrypt_key`. We're gonna keep a close eye on this. We can see that `pbVar3` will hold the value of `passwd.3309` so we'll rename `pbVar3` to `password`.

Next, in the *while* loop, we can see some *XOR* operations being done on the `password`:

```c
while (pbVar3 + 4 != ubuf) {
  *pbVar3 = *pbVar3 ^ 0xa7;
  pbVar3[1] = pbVar3[1] ^ 0x8b;
  pbVar3[2] = pbVar3[2] ^ 0x2d;
  pbVar3[3] = pbVar3[3] ^ 5;
  pbVar3 = pbVar3 + 4;
}
```

This could be an indication of an obfuscation or encryption scheme. We'll take a closer look at this by trying to reimplement the operation in a Python script.

Firstly, we need to get the hex data that `passwd.3309` is pointing to, we can do this by looking at the **Bytes** window in Ghidra:

![fw_decrypt passwd bytes](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-fw_decrypt-passwd-bytes.png)

We'll copy all those highlighted bytes into a Python array:

```py
passwd = [0x95, 0xb3, 0x15, 0x32, 0xe4, 0xe4, 0x43, 0x6b, 0x90, 0xbe, 0x1b, 0x31, 0xa7, 0x8b, 0x2d, 0x05]
```

Next, we need to implement a *while* loop that can do all the XOR operations of the decompiled *while* loop:

```py
i = 0
while (i < len(passwd)):
	passwd[i] ^= 0xa7
	passwd[i + 1] ^= 0x8b
	passwd[i + 2] ^= 0x2d
	passwd[i + 3] ^= 5
	
	i += 4
```

Once this loop is done, we can print out the password:

```py
print("".join(chr(byte) for byte in passwd))
```

And that's done, we now have the completed script:

```py
passwd = [0x95, 0xb3, 0x15, 0x32, 0xe4, 0xe4, 0x43, 0x6b, 0x90, 0xbe, 0x1b, 0x31, 0xa7, 0x8b, 0x2d, 0x05]

i = 0
while (i < len(passwd)):
	passwd[i] ^= 0xa7
	passwd[i + 1] ^= 0x8b
	passwd[i + 2] ^= 0x2d
	passwd[i + 3] ^= 5
	
	i += 4

print("".join(chr(byte) for byte in passwd))
```

If we run this, we get this as an output:

![fw_decrypt python output](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-fw_decrypt-python-output.png)

So that means the password or the AES decrypt key of this program is "*2887Conn7564*". We can now use this to decrypt the encrypted file. We need to convert this into hexadecimal first before we can use it:

```py
print("".join(hex(byte)[2:] for byte in passwd))
```

This Python line will give us this hex value: *32383837436f6e6e373536340000*.

# The decryption

Now that we have the key, how do we decrypt this firmware?

We can use *OpenSSL* to decrypt this. The `openssl` command-line tool does support AES 128-bit ECB mode so let's use that. 

Before we can start decrypting, remember that back when we were reverse engineering the `ecb128Decrypt` function and doing the `hexdump`, we found out the exact amount of padding bytes this encrypted firmware has: *0x28* in hex or 40 in decimal. 

So in order to decrypt the data, we need to remove the padding bytes first or it will also decrypt the padding bytes. I'll use `dd`:

```bash
$ dd if=moxa-nport-w2150a-w2250a-series-firmware-v2.2.rom of=firmware-offseted.encrypted bs=1 skip=40
8874768+0 records in
8874768+0 records out
8874768 bytes transferred in 54.281718 secs (163495 bytes/sec)
```

> **Note**: `bs` means block size, `skip` means bytes to skip

Now we can use `openssl` to decrypt the new `firmware-offseted.encrypted` file by running it in decrypt mode and giving it our AES decrypt key:

```bash
openssl aes-128-ecb -d -K "32383837436f6e6e373536340000" -in firmware-offseted.encrypted -out firmware.decrypted
```

This will output a `firmware.decrypted` file. Now if we run `binwalk` on this decrypted file:

![firmware decrypted openssl](/images/firmware-decrypt/nport-firmware-firmware-decrypted-openssl.png)

Now we can actually extract the files into `_firmware.decrypted.extracted`:

```bash
binwalk -e firmware.decrypted
cd _firmware.decrypted.extracted
```

Remember to give the `squashfs-root` directories execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x -R squashfs-root*
```

Now we have full access to the firmware:

# The conclusion

That was how to reverse engineer and decrypt an encrypted firmware. We learned a fair about how to analyze a firmware for vulnerabilities and exploit those vulnerabilities.
